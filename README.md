# Applied_Genomics
This repository collects my project for the Applied Genomics course. It includes the presentation on the chromosome-scale reference genome of the Alpine marmot, integrating multi-omics to study hibernation and high-altitude adaptation. Teaching materials (notes, transcripts, slides) used during the course are also provided for study purposes.
