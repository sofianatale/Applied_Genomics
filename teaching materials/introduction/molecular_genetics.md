# Molecular Genetics

## Overview
Molecular genetics focuses on the **chemical nature of genes**: their structure, function, and how genetic information is **encoded, replicated, expressed, and regulated**.

It includes:
- DNA **replication**, **transcription**, and **translation**  
- **Gene regulation** (control of expression)  
- Post-transcriptional and post-translational processes (e.g., **alternative splicing**, **protein modifications**)  

A single gene can produce multiple proteins due to these mechanisms.

## Core Techniques
The technical foundations of molecular genetics include:

- **Recombinant DNA technology**  
- **DNA sequencing** (1st generation and Next-Generation Sequencing, NGS)  
- **Library construction**  
- **PCR amplification**  
- **Hybridization techniques**  
- **Gel electrophoresis**  

## Sanger Sequencing (First Generation Sequencing)
An early but fundamental sequencing method.

### Principle
- Based on **controlled DNA synthesis** with chain-terminating nucleotides.  
- Requires:  
  - DNA template (to be sequenced)  
  - A **primer** (defines start point)  
  - **dNTPs** (normal nucleotides)  
  - **ddNTPs** (modified nucleotides, terminate synthesis)  
  - DNA polymerase enzyme  

### Process
1. Run **four reactions** (one per nucleotide).  
2. Incorporate normal or modified nucleotides randomly during synthesis.  
3. Modified nucleotides block extension, generating **DNA fragments of different lengths**.  
4. Fragments are separated by **electrophoresis**, which sorts by size.  
5. Detection is based on **light or color** emitted by the final ddNTP.  
6. By analyzing fragment lengths and terminal nucleotides, the **DNA sequence** is reconstructed.  

### Key Features
- Uses **linear amplification** (millions of fragments of varying lengths).  
- Highly accurate but **low throughput** compared to modern methods.  
- Provided the foundation for todayâ€™s sequencing technologies.
