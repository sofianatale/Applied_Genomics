# Quantitative Genetics

## Overview
Quantitative genetics (genetics of **complex traits**) studies traits influenced by **many genes** and **environmental factors**.  
- Examples: stature, eye color, running ability, survival to adulthood.  
- Traits can be continuous (height), discrete (litter size), or binary (survival yes/no).  

Key concept:  
\[
\text{Phenotype (P)} = \text{Genotype effect (G)} + \text{Environment effect (E)}
\]

## Components of Phenotypic Variation
### Genotype Effect
- **Additive effect (A)** → sum of contributions of alleles across loci  
- **Dominance effect (D)** → interaction between alleles at the same locus  
- **Interaction effect (I)** → gene–gene (epistatic) interactions  

### Environment Effect
- **Permanent environmental effect**  
- **Temporary environmental effect**  

Thus:  
\[
\text{Var(P)} = \text{Var(G)} + \text{Var(E)}
\]  

Where:  
- Var(G) = additive + dominance + interaction variance  
- Var(E) = environmental variance

## Heritability
**Definition**: The proportion of phenotypic variance explained by genetic variance.  

\[
h^2 = \frac{\text{Var(G)}}{\text{Var(P)}}
\]

- **Low heritability**: < 0.1  
- **Medium heritability**: 0.1 – 0.4  
- **High heritability**: > 0.4  

To estimate heritability, genetic relationships between individuals must be considered.  

## Applications
Quantitative genetics is essential to:
- Understand **variation and covariation among relatives** in natural and managed populations  
- Study the **dynamics of evolutionary change**  
- Improve animals and plants (breeding programs)  
- Investigate **complex diseases** in humans  

Because traits are influenced by **many genes + environment**, it is often difficult to pinpoint the role of single genes.

## Examples
- **Simple trait** → hair color: recessive allele makes hair red  
- **Complex traits**:  
  - Running ability → depends on muscle size, fiber type  
  - Newborn weight → complex but genetically determined  
  - Stature → heritability ≈ 0.5–0.7  
  - Adult weight → complex, influenced by genes + environment
