# Classical Genetics

## Overview
Genetics is the discipline that studies biological diversity at different levels: **genomes, populations, individuals, and organisms**.  
Diversity is the driving force of genetics. Traditionally, genetics is divided into four domains:

1. **Classical genetics (Transmission/Formal genetics)** → heredity and segregation of traits  
2. **Molecular genetics** → DNA and gene-level mechanisms  
3. **Population genetics** → variability within and across populations  
4. **Quantitative genetics** → polygenic traits (less central in applied genomics)

## Classical Genetics
- Focuses on the **principles of heredity** and how traits are transmitted.  
- Chromosomes are the **physical carriers of heredity**, containing multiple genes.  
- **Crossing over** during meiosis reshuffles paired chromosomes; recombination frequency depends on distance between loci.  
- First **genetic maps** were developed in *Drosophila*, later replaced by genome sequencing.  
- **Loci** (then unknown elements) were studied by phenotype changes (e.g., eye color, wing shape).  

**Key concept**: Only loci with different alleles (visible phenotypic effects) could be detected in classical genetics.

## Mendel’s Discoveries
Gregor Mendel formulated the **laws of heredity** from *Pisum sativum* experiments:

- **Genotype vs Phenotype**  
  - *Genotype*: allele combination (hidden)  
  - *Phenotype*: observable traits = genotype + environment  

- **Dominance**  
  - Dominant allele (e.g., Tall **T**) masks recessive (dwarf **t**)  
  - Codominance → intermediate phenotypes possible  

### Mendel’s Laws
1. **Law of Segregation**  
   - Each gamete carries one allele from each locus  
   - Classic **3:1 phenotype ratio** in F2 generation (tall vs dwarf plants)  

2. **Law of Independent Assortment**  
   - Alleles for different traits assort independently if loci are on different chromosomes  
   - Statistical ratio: **9:3:3:1** in dihybrid crosses  

## Pedigrees
- Graphical representation of inheritance across generations.  
- **Symbols**:  
  - ○ female | ⬜ male | ◆ unknown sex  
  - Empty = healthy | Filled = affected | Half-filled = carrier  
- Useful in **inbred species** or high familial studies.  

## PLINK
- A software for **genotype–phenotype data management**.  
- Input: text file (one row per sample, multiple fields).  
- Columns: family, individual ID, parents, sex (1=male, 2=female, 0=unknown), phenotype (case/control).  
- Additional genotype columns allow genome-wide representation.  
- Facilitates **high-throughput genotyping analysis** and **genome-wide association studies (GWAS)**.

## Cytogenetics
- Visualization of chromosomes (e.g., during metaphase).  
- Involves **staining techniques** to identify structure and number.  
- Standardized nomenclature (e.g., human chromosome 1 = same globally).  
- Before the genomic era: goal was to locate genes along chromosomes; now full sequence content is known.

## Linkage Disequilibrium (LD)
- **Definition**: Non-random association of alleles at different loci in a population.  
- Stronger LD when loci are physically closer → tend to be inherited together.  
- **Haplotypes**: groups of variants inherited together.  

**Measure**:  
- **Centimorgan (cM)** introduced by T.H. Morgan.  
- 1 cM ≈ 1% recombination frequency.  
- Limit: loci ≥ 50 cM apart behave as if on different chromosomes.

## Sex Chromosomes & Determination
- In mammals: **XX = female, XY = male**.  
- Pseudoautosomal regions (**PARR**) allow limited recombination between X and Y.  

Other systems:  
- **X0 system** (insects): XX = female, X = male  
- **ZW system** (birds): ZZ = male, ZW = female  
- **Haplo-diploid system** (bees): fertilized (diploid) = female, unfertilized (haploid) = male  
- **Environmental systems**: e.g., temperature-dependent sex determination in reptiles  

## Chromosomal Maps
- Represent **gene positions and distances** based on recombination frequency.  
- Closely linked genes → low recombination.  
- By summing recombination distances, a chromosome’s length can be reconstructed.
