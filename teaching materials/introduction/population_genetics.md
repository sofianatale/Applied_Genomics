# Population Genetics

## Overview
Population genetics studies the **genetic composition of populations** (groups of individuals of the same species) and how this composition changes **over space and time**.  
Since **evolution = genetic change**, population genetics is essentially the study of **evolutionary processes** at the genetic level.

Key concept:  
- Focus on **allele frequencies** in populations.  
- Allele frequencies can be used to infer **genotype frequencies**, under certain assumptions.  

## Hardy–Weinberg Equilibrium
A central model in population genetics used to predict expected genotype frequencies from allele frequencies.  

### Assumptions
The population must satisfy the following conditions:  
- Diploid organisms  
- Only **sexual reproduction** occurs  
- **Non-overlapping generations** (parents do not breed with offspring)  
- **Random mating**  
- **Infinite population size** (no genetic drift)  
- Equal allele frequencies in sexes (otherwise additional rules for sex-linked genes)  
- **No migration, mutation, selection, or gene flow**  

If all assumptions hold, allele and genotype frequencies remain constant across generations.

## Allele and Genotype Frequencies
- **Allele frequency** =  
  \[
  \frac{\text{Number of copies of a specific allele}}{\text{Total number of alleles at that locus in the population}}
  \]

- **Genotype frequency** =  
  \[
  \frac{\text{Number of individuals with a given genotype}}{\text{Total number of individuals in the population}}
  \]

### Example: Bi-allelic locus
- Let **p** = frequency of the dominant allele  
- Let **q** = frequency of the recessive allele  

Since only two alleles exist:  
\[
p + q = 1
\]

The expected **genotype frequencies** follow:  
\[
(p + q)^2 = p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1
\]

- **p²** → homozygous dominant (AA)  
- **2pq** → heterozygous (Aa)  
- **q²** → homozygous recessive (aa)  

This is the **Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium equation**.  

## Interpretation
- If the observed population frequencies differ from Hardy–Weinberg expectations, this indicates that **evolutionary forces** (e.g., selection, drift, migration, mutation) may be acting.  
- The model is not a description of real populations (since assumptions are idealized), but a **reference baseline** to study deviations.
