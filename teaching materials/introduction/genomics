# Genomics

## What is a Genome?
- The **entire genetic content** of an organism (DNA sequence).  
  Example: `…ACGTGTGCGTGAAAGGG…`  
- Original definition (Hans Winker, 1920): *collection of genes in a haploid set of chromosomes*.  
- Current meaning: **all DNA in a cell**, nuclear and extra-nuclear.  

## What is Genomics?
Genomics = study of **all genes in an organism** and their interactions.  
A multidisciplinary field combining:  
- **Genetics**  
- **Molecular biology**  
- **Robotics** (automation for data generation)  
- **Computing** (data processing and analysis)  

### Core Tools
- Recombinant DNA technology  
- DNA sequencing (Sanger, Next-Generation Sequencing – NGS)  
- Library construction  
- PCR amplification  
- Hybridization & electrophoresis  
- **High-throughput** sequencing platforms  

## Historical Context
- **1986** – Thomas Roderick introduced the term *genomics* for genome mapping, sequencing, and characterization.  
- **Human Genome Project (1990–2003)**  
  - Sequenced **3 billion base pairs**  
  - High-quality (< 1 error per 10k bases)  
  - Required development of **automated sequencing**  
- Sequencing of **yeast & bacterial genomes** → birth of **comparative genomics**  

## Applied Genomics
Applied genomics = use of tools, technologies, and designs to analyze genomes and extract meaningful information.  
- Explain population structure  
- Identify genes affecting phenotypes  
- Support medical, agricultural, and evolutionary research  

## Omics Expansion
- **Functional genomics** → gene expression and function  
- **Transcriptomics** → RNA profiles  
- **Proteomics** → protein complement  
- **Metabolomics** → metabolites  
- **Phenomics** → phenotype data  

## Diversity of Genomes
### Three Domains of Life
1. **Bacteria** – simple but share some genes with humans  
2. **Eukaryota** – complex genomes (nuclear + organellar)  
3. **Archaea** – extreme environments  
   - Thermophiles (heat)  
   - Halophiles (salt)  
   - Methanogens (methane producers)  

### Types of Genomes
1. **Viruses** → DNA or RNA genomes, sometimes segmented  
2. **Prokaryotes** → circular genome + plasmids, no reference genome concept  
3. **Eukaryotes**  
   - Nuclear genome (main DNA)  
   - Mitochondrial genome (~60k bp)  
   - Chloroplast genome (plants, third genome)  

## Data & Databases
- **GenBank** → repository of DNA sequences with metadata (species, source, annotations).  
- **Whole Genome Shotgun (WGS)** projects → randomly sequence DNA fragments and assemble later.  
- **Comparative genomics** → compare annotated and unannotated genomes to infer gene functions.  

## Big Data in Genomics
NGS has made genomic data **astronomical**:  
- **Terabyte (TB)** = 10¹² bytes  
- **Petabyte (PB)** = 10¹⁵ bytes  
- **Exabyte (EB)** = 10¹⁸ bytes  
- **Zettabyte (ZB)** = 10²¹ bytes (= 1 million TB!)  

Challenges:  
- **Storage**  
- **Transfer**  
- **Analysis**  

Sometimes it is **better to mine existing data** than generate more.  

## Metadata Importance
Metadata = contextual information accompanying genomic data.  
- Example: sex or ethnicity can influence phenotype and must be reported.  
- Some metadata can be **inferred from the data** itself (e.g., sex from Y chromosome, ancestry from SNPs).  
- Each dataset typically corresponds to **one individual**.
