# Runs of Homozygosity (ROH) and the Genomic Inbreeding Coefficient (F_ROH)

**Goal:** quantify individual- and population-level inbreeding from genome-wide genotypes or sequencing by identifying **Runs of Homozygosity (ROH)** and summarizing them as a **genomic inbreeding coefficient** (*F_ROH*).

## 1) What is an ROH?

A **Run of Homozygosity (ROH)** is a **contiguous chromosomal segment** where all informative polymorphic sites are **homozygous**.

- Conceptually: two haplotypes (maternal/paternal) carry **the same alleles** across a stretch of the genome.
- **Boundaries** of a ROH are defined by the first heterozygous SNPs (or missing-data limits) on each side.
- ROHs come in **different sizes** (short/medium/long), reflecting **time since common ancestry**:
  - **Long** ROH → recent common ancestors (consanguinity, strong bottlenecks).
  - **Short** ROH → older events / background LD.

## 2) From ROH to genomic inbreeding: *F_ROH*

Let:
- `nROH` = number of ROH segments in an individual  
- `L_ROH` = average ROH length (Mb)  
- `S_ROH` = **sum of all ROH lengths** in an individual (Mb)  
- `L_GEN` = total **autosomal** genome length considered (Mb)

Then the **genomic inbreeding coefficient** is:
\[
F_{\text{ROH}} = \frac{S_{\text{ROH}}}{L_{\text{GEN}}}
\]

Interpretation: **% of the autosomal genome contained in ROH**. Higher values = higher genomic inbreeding.

## 3) IBD vs IBS and relation to pedigree (F_PED)

- **IBD (Identical by Descent)**: two alleles are copies from a **common ancestor** (what pedigree-based \(F_{\text{PED}}\) targets).
- **IBS (Identical by State)**: alleles look identical but origin is unknown.

**ROH-based methods count homozygosity regardless of origin (IBD + IBS).**  
However, **long ROH** are unlikely to arise by chance → **more likely IBD**.  
Thus, *F_ROH* approximates the genome-wide **autozygosity** and is often more **informative** than \(F_{\text{PED}}\) when pedigrees are shallow/incomplete.

## 4) Calling ROH: key choices & biases

Different methods ≈ different **windows/thresholds**:

- **Window definition**
  - Number of SNPs to define the sliding window.
  - **Max heterozygous SNPs** permitted within a window (to tolerate genotyping error).
  - **Max missing SNPs** permitted.
  - **Minimum ROH length** (in kb/Mb).
- **SNP density**
  - Low-density arrays → require **fewer SNPs** per ROH and **larger minimum length**.
  - High-density arrays/seq → stricter thresholds possible.
- **Genotyping error & missingness**
  - A single miscalled heterozygote can break a ROH.
  - Define small tolerances for **HET** and **MISS** per window.
- **Linkage disequilibrium (LD) & recombination rate**
  - Populations with **high LD** (some livestock) tend to produce **longer background ROH**; set **longer minimum length** to avoid false positives.
  - In **humans** (lower LD), minimum ROH can be shorter.
- **Reference length**
  - Always restrict to **autosomes** when computing *F_ROH* and report the **exact `L_GEN`** used.

> Practical tip: choose thresholds guided by **literature for your species**, perform **sensitivity analysis** (vary parameters), and report them explicitly.

## 5) Typical parameterization (rule-of-thumb)

| Platform | Min SNPs per ROH | Max HET in window | Max MISS in window | Min ROH length |
|---------:|------------------:|------------------:|-------------------:|---------------:|
| 50K SNP array | 30–60 | 1 | 2–3 | 1–2 Mb |
| 700K SNP array | 50–100 | 1 | 2–3 | 0.5–1 Mb |
| WGS (≥10×) | length-driven | allow occasional errors | allow | 0.3–0.5 Mb |

*Adjust for species-specific LD.*

## 6) Computing ROH and F_ROH with PLINK

> PLINK implements a sliding-window ROH caller for SNP-array data.

Example (human-like settings, autosomes only):

```bash
# 1) Basic ROH calling
plink \
  --bfile data/genotypes_autosomes \
  --homozyg \
  --homozyg-window-snp 50 \
  --homozyg-snp 50 \
  --homozyg-kb 1000 \
  --homozyg-density 100 \
  --homozyg-gap 1000 \
  --homozyg-window-het 1 \
  --homozyg-window-missing 2 \
  --homozyg-window-threshold 0.05 \
  --out results/roh_calls

# Outputs:
#   results/roh_calls.hom   (per-ROH segments)
#   results/roh_calls.hom.indiv (per-individual summary: nROH, S_ROH, mean length)

# 2) Compute F_ROH per individual
#    L_GEN must be the autosomal genome length analyzed (e.g., 2,867,000 kb for GRCh38 autosomes)
```
### Computing \(F_{\text{ROH}}\)

\[
F_{\text{ROH}}=\frac{\mathrm{KB\_HOM}}{L_{\text{GEN (kb)}}}
\]

Where `KB_HOM` is per individual from `*.hom.indiv`.

*For WGS, prefer length-based approaches (post-process `*.hom`) and consider depth/variant QC filters.*

### 7) How to read ROH summaries

**Per individual**
- `nROH` ↑ and `S_ROH` ↑ → more inbreeding.

**Distribution by length**
- **Long ROH** (e.g., > 8 Mb): recent consanguinity.  
- **Medium ROH** (4–8 Mb): intermediate events.  
- **Short ROH** (1–4 Mb): ancient background/LD.

**Across the population**
- **Large, outbred population** → few, short ROH.  
- **Admixed population** → very few ROH, small `S_ROH`.  
- **Small or isolated population** → more ROH, longer average length.  
- **Recent consanguinity** → many long ROH.  
- **Bottleneck** → increased ROH count; if followed by inbreeding, also longer ROH.

### 8) ROH islands (population-level signal)

A **ROH island** is a genomic region with **high ROH frequency** across individuals.

- Often indicates **selection** (natural or artificial) favoring homozygosity at/near a locus.
- **Visualization:** Manhattan-like plot with chromosomal position (x) vs ROH frequency (y).

**Next steps**
- Map genes in the island.  
- Test functional hypotheses (e.g., pathogen resistance, local adaptation).

---

### 9) Linking ROH to pedigree and HWE

- **Inbreeding depression** emerges as increased **homozygote** frequencies (no change in allele frequencies), producing deviations from **Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium**.
- Test deviations with a **\(\chi^2\)** test (df = 1) using observed vs expected genotype counts.
- \(F_{\text{PED}}\) may **underestimate** inbreeding when pedigrees are shallow/incomplete; \(F_{\text{ROH}}\) leverages the **realized** genomic mosaic.

- ROH calling parameters (window SNPs, max HET/MISS, min length, density, gap).
