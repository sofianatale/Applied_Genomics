# Population Genomics – Basic Tools and Concepts

## 1. Hardy–Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE)

A population is in equilibrium when **allele and genotype frequencies remain constant across generations**, under the following assumptions:

- Very large population size  
- No mutations occurring  
- No natural selection  
- Diploid organisms  
- No migration  
- Balanced sex ratio and no geographic barriers  
- Random mating  

When these assumptions are violated, we can study how a population changes under evolutionary forces (e.g., drift, migration, selection).

## 2. Genetic Variation and Genotyping

- **Variants (polymorphisms)** are the informative parts of the genome.  
- **Genotyping** = determination of the genotype at polymorphic loci.  
- High-throughput genotyping studies enable:
  - Large-scale variant identification  
  - Association with phenotypes (diseases, production traits, etc.)  
  - Applications in **population genomics** and **genomic selection**  

Key principle:  
\[
P = G + E
\]  
where **Phenotype = Genotype + Environment**.

## 3. High-Throughput Genotyping Tools (Microarrays)

### Main Features
- Scalable for large population studies  
- Trusted and widely adopted  
- Low per-sample cost  
- Genome-wide variant detection (especially SNPs)  
- Based on **Linkage Disequilibrium (LD)**: only a subset of SNPs is needed to capture genomic variability  

### Data and Standards
- Two main files:
  - One with **chromosome coordinates** of SNPs  
  - One with **mapping information**  
- Requires a **reference genome**:
  - Can improve over time, but may contain gaps and repetitive regions  
  - Essential for standardizing comparisons across studies  

## 4. Applications in Agriculture

- **GWAS & QTL mapping**: identify markers linked to production traits.  
- **Genomic selection**: predict breeding values using genome-wide markers.  
- **Marker-Assisted Selection (MAS) & Breeding (MAB)**: select traits based on linked markers.  
- **Parentage testing**:  
  - Confirms ancestry and pedigree accuracy  
  - Identifies carriers of defective genes  
  - Uses Mendelian segregation to exclude/confirm parents  

## 5. Reduced Representation Libraries (RRL)

A cost-effective method to focus sequencing on part of the genome:
- Digest DNA with restriction enzymes  
- Avoid repetitive sequences (e.g., Alu repeats)  
- Sequence only **informative, unique regions**  
- Map against the reference genome  

This strategy reduces both cost and complexity by filtering out redundant repetitive elements.

## 6. Sequencing Output Example

- **19 libraries** sequenced on a 1G analyzer  
- Average: 1 SNP every ~30 kb → ~1 million SNPs needed  
- Results:
  - 2.6 million SNPs initially identified  
  - Reduced to ~160,000 informative SNPs  
  - Final **60k SNP assay** designed  

Note: Some SNP assays fail if one expected allele is not captured.

## 7. Key Insights

- Population genomics leverages **variation between and within populations**.  
- **High-throughput genotyping** reduces cost while retaining power to detect informative variants.  
- **Reference genomes**, even if imperfect, provide the backbone for SNP mapping.  
- Applications range from **evolutionary genetics** to **agricultural improvement**.
